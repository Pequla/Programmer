# Programmer
Programmer is a discord bot designed for my friend zone study room, it can fetch for memes, and send useful links relating to all university tasks.

## Commands

- `!test` or `!testus` - Displays direct links to the MMTutor testing platform
- `!meme` - Sends a fresh meme from Reddit
- `!joke` - Sends a fresh joke from the Official Joke API
- `!announce` - Sends an announcement

### Announcements

- `!announce set title` - Sets title
- `!announce set message` - Sets message body
- `!announce test` - See the current look of the message before sending
- `!announce send` - Sends it
- `!announce help` - Links to this page :)
- `!announce reset` - Resets all the sets (this is done also automatically after sending)
